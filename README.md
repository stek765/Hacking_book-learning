## 📘 Overview

This repository is a personal project created while studying the book *“Hacking: The Art of Exploitation”*.  
It contains my experiments, test code, notes, and exercises based on the book's content.

The goal is to understand and practice fundamental concepts in exploitation, low-level programming, and debugging in a hands-on way.
